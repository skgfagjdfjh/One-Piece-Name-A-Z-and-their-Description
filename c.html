<p style="color:red;">Although Corazon has exceptional physical abilities that make him a great fighter, his greatest strength is his ability to deceive others. As a spy for the Marines, Corazon was able to hide his true mission and Devil Fruit abilities from the other Donquixote Pirates, including Doflamingo.
